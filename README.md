Restaurant Management System – SQL Project

📌 Introduction
This project presents a comprehensive Restaurant Management System developed using SQL (PostgreSQL). 
It is designed to streamline restaurant operations such as customer and staff management, order handling, menu categorization, inventory monitoring, 
table tracking, payment processing, and business analytics. This system is capable of supporting automation and access control to suit real-world operational needs.

📊 Dataset Used
The dataset `restaurant_management_large_data.xlsx` includes sample data for various entities such as Customers, 
Menu Items, Inventory, Orders, and Staffs. It is used to populate the database tables and test the SQL operations defined in the project.

🛠️ SQL Script Overview
The core of the project is built using the SQL file `Restaurant Management System.sql`, which defines the entire schema, data operations, and advanced business logic. The major components include:
•	- Database schema creation for all entities
•	- Stored procedures for customer registration, order processing, inventory updates, etc.
•	- Functions for business logic like loyalty discounts, low stock checks
•	- Triggers for automation such as inventory updates and table status changes
•	- Advanced queries for insights like sales trends, peak hours, and staff performance
•	- Role-based access control setup for Admin, Manager, and Staff

✅ Key Features
•	- Customer and Staff Management
•	- Order and Payment Tracking
•	- Inventory Monitoring with Low Stock Alerts
•	- Category-wise Menu and Sales Reporting
•	- Role-based Security and User Access Control
•	- Automation with Triggers and Scheduled Procedures

📈 Use Cases
•	- Efficient handling of customer orders and loyalty programs
•	- Real-time tracking of inventory and table availability
•	- Generating periodic reports for revenue, sales, and inventory
•	- Staff performance analysis and schedule optimization

🚀 Getting Started
1. Open PostgreSQL or your preferred SQL client.
2. Execute the `Restaurant Management System.sql` file to create tables and procedures.
3. Load the Excel data into the respective tables (manual or via ETL tools).
4. Test stored procedures and queries for validation.

📌 Conclusion
This SQL-based Restaurant Management System serves as a powerful backend framework for managing restaurant operations efficiently. The inclusion of stored procedures, triggers, and analytics queries helps automate routine tasks and extract business insights. This makes it ideal for deployment in real-world restaurant chains.
